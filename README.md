This project simulates the running of multiple games of Baccarat, also known as Punto Banco, and prints out statistics based on the results of the games. Players place bets on the player, the bank, or a tie. The dealer deals two cards to each player, starting with the player to their left. If either the player or the bank has a total of eight or nine, the coup is over and the result is announced. If neither hand has eight or nine, the dealer may draw additional cards.
